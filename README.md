# Solidity Game - Token Attack - Undeflow Attack

_Inspired by OpenZeppelin's [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com), Token Level_

⚠️Do not try on mainnet!

## Task

Hacker the basic token contract below.

1. You are given 20 tokens to start with and you will beat the game if you somehow manage to get your hands on any additional tokens. Preferably a very large amount of tokens.

_Hint:_

1. What is an odometer?

## What will you learn?

1. Solidity Security Consideration
2. **Underflow** and **Overflow** in use of unsigned integers

## What is the most difficult challenge?

**You won't get success to attack if the target contract has been complied in Solidity 0.8.0 or uppper** 🤔

> [**Solidity v0.8.0 Breaking Changes**](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.5/080-breaking-changes.html?highlight=underflow#silent-changes-of-the-semantics)
> Arithmetic operations revert on **underflow** and **overflow**. You can use `unchecked { ... }` to use the previous wrapping behaviour.
> Checks for overflow are very common, so we made them the default to increase readability of code, even if it comes at a slight increase of gas costs.

I had tried to do everything in Solidity 0.8.5 at first time, but it didn't work, as it reverted transactions everytime it met underflow.

Finally, I found that Solidity included those checks by defaults while using sliencely more gas.

So, don't you need to use [`SafeMath`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol)?

## Source Code

⚠️This contract contains a bug or risk. Do not use on mainnet!

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Token {
  mapping(address => uint256) balances;
  uint256 public totalSupply;

  constructor(uint256 _initialSupply) public {
    balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = _initialSupply;
  }

  function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    return true;
  }

  function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance) {
    return balances[_owner];
  }
}

```

## Configuration

### Install Truffle cli

_Skip if you have already installed._

```
npm install -g truffle
```

### Install Dependencies

```
yarn install
```

## Test and Attack!💥

### Run Tests

```
truffle develop
test
```

You should take ownership of the target contract successfully.

```
truffle(develop)> test
Using network 'develop'.


Compiling your contracts...
===========================
